        </STRONG>Could you give us some information on your music background -- when did you first



        start creating music?&nbsp; What prompted you to go into music and how old were you?<p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; I was 11 years old when I



        started&nbsp; composing.&nbsp; I remember the first time I sat down at the piano and my



        feet barely reached the foot pedal. I pressed the pedal down and hit as many notes as I



        could.&nbsp; The effect was overwhelming. It was like a door opened up and I could see



        beyond this reality. That's when I started&nbsp; putting sounds together.  Of



        course, I was duly educated in the arts of the piano, violin and science of harmony and my



        very first written piece was like classical 18th century music. But ever since that moment



        I also moved on and forward and changed styles with every piece, however I saw fit.&nbsp;



        When I was 16 I bought a reel-to-reel machine and started my own electronic studio.&nbsp;</p>


        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:</STRONG>&nbsp; Where did you grow up? Europe ?</p>
        
        
        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; Yes, I was born in
          
          
          
          Guetersloh, a small town in Germany where BMG has its headquarters. It's not far from the
          
          
          
          Teutoburg Forest, where the Roman legions were slaughtered by Arminius and German history
          
          
          
          began.</p>
          
        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:</STRONG>&nbsp; What bands or music
          
          
          
          were you interested in while growing up?
          
         </p>
          
          <p>  <STRONG>Rothkamm</STRONG>:</strong>&nbsp; Here are the 7 magic records of my youth: <STRONG>Pink</STRONG> <STRONG>Floyd</STRONG>
          
          
          -- &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;; <STRONG>Caravan</STRONG> -- &quot;For Girls who grow
          
          
          
          Plump in the night&quot;; <STRONG>Bee</STRONG> <STRONG>Gees</STRONG> -- &quot;Spirits
          
          
          
          &nbsp; Having Flown&quot;; <STRONG>Jean</STRONG> <STRONG>Claude</STRONG> <STRONG>Eloy</STRONG>
          
          
          
          -- &quot;Yo-In&quot;; <STRONG>Karlheinz</STRONG> <STRONG>Stockhausen</STRONG> --
          
          
          
          &quot;Hymnen&quot;; <STRONG>John</STRONG> <STRONG>Cage</STRONG> -- &quot;Roaratorio&quot;; <STRONG>Frank</STRONG>
          
          
          
          <STRONG>Zappa</STRONG> -- &quot;Studio Tan&quot;. The first cassette I bought with my own money was <STRONG>Pink</STRONG>
          
          
          
          <STRONG>Floyd</STRONG>'s &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; when I was 12. I went into the
          
          
          
          record store in the small town of Nuertingen where we were living, and asked for something
          
          
          
          electronic. The woman behind the counter pointed to the shelves of cassettes and said:
          
          
          
          &quot;Over there, the one with cow&quot;.&nbsp; I opened it and the cover smelled like
          
          
          
          grass.&nbsp; I mean real green grass, and I thought this is part of the whole package. </p>
          
          
          <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:</STRONG>&nbsp; Was there any event(s) in particular you remember that
  
  
  
  caught your interest in music?</p>
        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>



        &nbsp; No, but I remember I thought I'd be an airplane pilot before I wanted to be a



        composer.&nbsp; I was very certain about what I was chosen to do.&nbsp; It took years



        before I realized that what I'm doing has precedent in Alchemy; it's the same procedure,



        methodology and objective. Through a transmutation of the prima materia&nbsp; (which can



        be absolutely anything) the alchemist also reaches transformation -- he's changed through



        the activity, the objective being to reach the elixir of life or the philosopher's stone.



        &nbsp; This is the tradition of the &quot;secret art&quot; and one knows it when one sees



        it. In this sense the word composer has to be understood from the Latin componere to put



        together.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>What type



        of machines or instruments do you use in creating your sounds/music?&nbsp; Can you give us



        a *gear list*?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; Sure,&nbsp; here's my <a



        href="http://FLUXRECORDS.com/vintage/list.html">gear list</a> </p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>Do you use



        all electronic machines or do you also incorporate *organic acoustics* in your music?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; I'm very interested in



        applying natural principles to technological processes. In that way all my work is



        &quot;organic&quot; as it is done algorithmically in bionic fashion. However, all recorded



        or transmitted sound can be &quot;organic&quot;, just as anything can be the base for



        transmutation. I find the radio or CD more natural than somebody playing a traditional



        instrument, because we are surrounded by electronically generated sound. I mean, I watch



        more &quot;Nature&quot; on Public Television than I actually go to the woods.&nbsp; Nature



        on TV is Nature in New York.&nbsp; By now this is my primary nature. This is organic.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh:</STRONG>&nbsp; Do



        you also create your own percussion? If so, what do you use and how do you make them -- I



        am particularly wondering about the percussion on <u>Planet Genius</u>, Track 4,



        &quot;<a href="http://rothkamm.com/work.cfm?opus=154">Tribe 251.</a>&quot;</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; All sound is either



        synthesized or sampled. On &quot;Tribe 251&quot; you can find the two approaches sampled



        percussion phrases from African sources plus Frequency Modulation (FM). I use a lot of FM



        since my first digital synthesizer was based on this. I implemented this synthesis



        technique for a Canadian software company for use in computer games. One day I wore



        make-up to work, so they fired me, and to this day I have no idea what they are doing with



        my formula.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>Do you



        ever play live? If so, is there anything you particularly enjoy about playing live?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; I used to do live



        &amp; occult performances of body manipulation and sex-related rituals (see Playboy, Feb.



        92) and did some raves in San Francisco. But ever since I moved to New York I became very



        weary of doing public spectacles. I also developed some chemical imbalances. On occasion



        reality becomes overwhelming and I have the impression my soul leaves my body and that



        seriously freaks me out. Since I'm very sensitive to the weather and atmospherics, things



        shifts around me sometimes .&nbsp; However, I did play at the Knitting Factory for <STRONG>Elliott



        Sharp</STRONG>'s &quot;Gigantor Dub Out&quot; and I've DJ'd.&nbsp; The last time was at



        the vOID, where I set up a sonic environment with web-projections (which you can see on



        the <STRONG><a href="http://fluxrecords.com/vintage/">Flux</a></STRONG><a href="http://fluxrecords.com/vintage/"> Web Space</a>) and spun some original '50s Mood Music. <br>



        <br>



        <STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>How about in the studio, what are some of



        your favorite things to do in the studio relative to creating your music?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; I usually get up



        around 6 o'clock in the morning and work for 12 hours, although I try to take a TV break



        in the late afternoon (I don't want to miss the Simpsons when they are on).&nbsp; I guess



        my day follows pretty closely the schedule of the monks I stayed with when I was in my



        teens. I have to take care of the label, the studio and the web. I devote a lot of time to



        experimentation &amp; research.&nbsp;&nbsp; My tracks require a lot of mutations until



        they are distilled and this usually takes a lot of time (a month or more per track &amp; I



        compose less each year), except when I am doing commercial work then there is&nbsp; no



        prep-time. In either case I score it out very fast. I work on one track at a time and the



        studio is configured and dedicated to this one track.&nbsp; The samplers are always on. I



        don't recreate set-ups and I never use the same samples &amp; sounds again.&nbsp; My



        methodology is algorithmic, in ever spinning cycles of procedures that get reiterated over



        and over again. I work in Cubase or Formula until the piece has a life of its own, then I



        rehearse the mix-down and do the final recording into the digital domain. If I make a



        mistake I will immediately record over it all tracks are recorded only once. This one copy



        will then be cut &amp; treated if necessary and stored to DAT. I have a catalog of about



        200 tracks.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>I have



        heard two of your releases; <a href="record.cfm?mystery-of-the-leaping-fish">Mystery of the



        Leaping Fish</a> and <a href="record.cfm?Planet-Genius">Planet Genius</a>. I



        found them to have a contrast in sound from one to the other. How would you describe and



        compare the music of those releases to someone who had never heard them? </p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; I never repeat the



        same piece twice. But the 2 CDs are my two areas of interest Working with beats and



        working with pure sound.&nbsp; Two sides of the same coin.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>Who did



        the vocals on &quot;Planet Genius&quot;, or were they sampled from somewhere else?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:</STRONG>&nbsp; All sampled.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:</STRONG>&nbsp; On track 8 you have



          Deborah Borchers listed as vocals. Who is she? Does she have any of her own work out? If



        so, how can we find it?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>Yes, she put stuff out



        with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Club">band</a> on a major.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>You also



        have a record label <a href="http://fluxrecords.com">Flux</a>. How and why did that



        come to be?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>The label exists only



        because I wanted to put stuff out and nobody else would, you know, to form a complete



        aesthetic.&nbsp; I realized that to get things done and to get them done right I simply



        had to do it myself.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:&nbsp; </STRONG>Do you ever remix



        anyone or is it all your work original?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>Yes, I did remix stuff



        for <STRONG>Harth</STRONG>, that's out on <STRONG>23Frankfurt</STRONG>, a vinyl imprint of



        <STRONG>Cop</STRONG> <STRONG>International</STRONG>.&nbsp; I was commissioned a number



        remixes although they were never released, because nobody knew what to do with them.&nbsp;



        They are pretty trippy stuff.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>What was



        the last book you read?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>&quot;Gnosis: The



        Nature &amp; History of Gnosticism&quot; by Kurt Rudolph, and also a new translation of



        &quot;The Nag Hammadi Library&quot;.&nbsp; This book contains the texts of a 4th century



        library of papyrus manuscripts that were derived from Gnostic sects.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:&nbsp; </STRONG>Your last film seen



        that you liked?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>I reckon it was



        &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (except the ending was brutal).</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:&nbsp; </STRONG>Do you create music



        for other projects? Film, CD-ROM or?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>Since 92 I did a



        number of commercials, in New York mostly for computer animated clips for Lucasfilm,



        Philips, Sears etc. Most of them were done in DMA 3-dimensional format that is;



        holographic projections without the use of glasses.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:&nbsp; </STRONG>Any new plans for



        Frank Rothkamm and <STRONG>Flux</STRONG> in the future you would like to let us know



        about?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>By the time this



        interview is out I'll be in the Colorado mountains &amp; will marry my sweetheart. Then



        we'll be off in our new and generic Toyota Corolla to live a new and generic life in Los



        Angeles. &nbsp; I'm looking forward to hearing from anyone who wants to meet me out there.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last Sigh:&nbsp; </STRONG>Any new releases you



        are working on?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>Yes, I'm working on



        two major releases right now, but I learned that talking about releases before they're



        complete is talking them out of existence.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>Do you



        have any words of wisdom for musicians starting out in the business?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>Western Paradise is



        beyond Pre-Sets.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>How do you



        feel about the use of MP3's in spreading whole tracks or entire CDs around the Internet



        without the permission of the artist?</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>I encourage it and



        will help any hacker with a serious intent in distributing my tracks.&nbsp; Everybody



        creates their own Karma.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh: </STRONG>Thanks so



        much for working with <STRONG>Last</STRONG> <STRONG>Sigh</STRONG>.</p>



        <p><STRONG>Rothkamm:&nbsp; </STRONG>You're welcome. Thank



        you for having me.</p>
