                    <P><span class="style2c">I 
                      was born in Germany in the town of G&uuml;tersloh, where 
                      the British Royal Air Force had a base. On my way to elementary 
                      school I passed by the military housing units every day 
                      and heard my first words in English. My first instrument 
                      was the recorder and I went to <strike>these</strike> group lessons and learned 
                      how to read and write music, but I really wanted to play 
                      the piano, so when my parents finally acquired one I figured 
                      out how to hold the sustain pedal and hit as many bass notes 
                      as possible. This was my first &quot;synthesis&quot; and 
                      the auditory effect it had on me was very profound. Then 
                      I took piano lessons. For the first year I had a teacher 
                      at a &quot;modern&quot; music school, where the lessons 
                      took place in a room filled with electric organs and electric 
                      pianos and everybody played while wearing a huge pair of 
                      headphones. The teacher would go around and listen in to 
                      what you're playing and correct it. I did not like this 
                      one bit, but of course I now realize that is how I first 
                      got to play on electric keyboard instruments from the 1970s 
                      and some of the organ presets were <STRIKE>actually</STRIKE> very unique. 
                      My family moved then to the small town of N&uuml;rtingen 
                      in Southern Germany and because of my accent I was a bit 
                      of an outsider and stayed home and took my drawings more 
                      seriously. I had just discovered perspective and how you 
                      can create optical illusions. At the age of 12 I started 
                      to compose music, which was first done in a very basic classical 
                      style, so basic in fact I remember the first &quot;leitmotif&quot; 
                      to this day. After hearing Paul Hindemith on the radio I 
                      eventually abandoned all forms of traditional notation and 
                      developed a graphic system of my own. In 1980 we moved to 
                      Moers, a city by the Rhine River north of D&uuml;sseldorf. 
                      I continued to study piano, eventually adding the violin 
                      and Harmonielehre (study of harmony), but my real interest 
                      was now in electronic music. I borrowed a lot of books from 
                      my local library and from what I read and saw in the pictures 
                      I somehow built my own &quot;sampling&quot; system around 
                      a UHER reel-to-reel tape machine. I was 16 years old. During 
                      the following 2 years I would then compose what is now known 
                      as '<A href="http://rothkamm.com/record.cfm?Moers Works">Moers Works</A>'. </span></P>

                    <P><BR>
                      <B>What do you think of avant-garde electronic music and 
                      where do you put yourself in that rich history ? Do you 
                      think there could be a link between your own work and early 
                      electronic experiments like WDR studio era for instance 
                    ?</B></font></P>
                    <P><span class="style2c">Early 
                      on I was confused about the dichotomy or the &quot;conflict&quot; 
                      between the French and German studios at the dawn of electronic 
                      music. All the books about electronic music that I read 
                      always contrasted the free association of &quot;Musique 
                      Concrete&quot; with the strict serialism of &quot;Elektronische 
                      Musik&quot;, as if they were <strike>are</strike> mutually exclusive. There was 
                      a lot of ideology involved with the creation of music made 
                      directly onto tape because of the tendency of post-war modernism 
                      to make a complete break with the past <strike>and to usher in the 
                      new atomic age. So,</strike> Right from the start my own work was 
                      infused with history and its dialectical movement. I am 
                      particularly fascinated by the *craft* involved in constructing 
                      these early experiments. It took them many hours to produce 
                      a few seconds of music. Each sound and sound effect had 
                      to be created one note a time. The mechanics were very labor-intensive. 
                      So from 2002-2006 I consciously re-enacted the modernist 
                      break towards my own work and adopted the anti-economical 
                      method, where the recording of the actual sound takes a 
                      tiny fraction of time compared to the enormous task involved 
                    of preparation and editing.</span> </font></P>
                    <P><B><BR>
                      Reading 
                      some of your declarations we wondered if you deliberately 
                      obliterate recent evolutions of electronic music. Is this 
                      true ? </B></font></P>

                    <P><span class="style2c">That 
                      is true, because there is no such thing as 'evolution' in 
                      music. However there is an illusion in society, perhaps 
                      linked to 19th century concepts of Hegelian History or Manifest 
                      Destiny, that culture is moving to a higher plateau and 
                      that progress is being made. So, the engine that drives 
                      the economy is thought to be the same engine that drives aesthetics 
                      and culture. The dominant illusion is that avant-garde music 
                      is the history of notation, that it started monophonic and 
                      evolved into ever more complex sounds resulting in today's 
                      holy trinity of instrumental farts, extended techniques 
                      and laptop errors. The dominant illusion in classical <strike>traditional</strike> 
                      music is the constant restoration of the past, the obsession 
                      to worship and re-enact the canon of masterpieces, which 
                      is in actuality a form of cultural pessimism, as it replaces 
                      the future with the past. <strike>So</strike> The works that I release are 
                      deliberately made to revolutionize time and genre: they 
                      are poly-temporal and non-economic and are located in the 
                      interior or at the border between categories; they are located 
                      on the inside of the dialectical movement of history. Basically, 
                      the target of my life's work is not only the obliteration 
                      of recent evolutions, but the critique of Totalization itself. 
                      As the works are always situated within real society, my 
                      output is not art, but simply a non-surplus-generating commodity. 
                      <STRIKE>As Adorno put it: &quot;Whoever submits to dialectical discipline, 
                      must unquestionably pay with the bitter sacrifice of the 
                      qualitative polyvalence of experience.&quot; That's a bummer. 
                      But I feel that</STRIKE> just as society has to break its dependence 
                      on a single source of depleting energy, so aesthetics, and 
                      with it music, will have to do the same.</span></P>
                    <P><BR>
                      <B>Why a young composer like you chose to work almost solely 
                      on vintage computers and outdated technology ? Do you sometimes 
                      play on laptops ?</B></font></P>
                    <P><span class="style2c">Unfortunately, 
                      I'm not that young unless you consider 43 the new 23. I 
                      work on vintage computers because they have no real exchange 
                      value in today's society, they have unique Digital-to-Analog-Converters, 
                      they are carriers of history and are easy to find in thrift 
                      stores and junk shops. This is almost like archeology: &quot;Let's 
                      see how far this little object will carry me&quot;. Technology 
                      and aesthetics are only outdated if they are no longer useful 
                      or are no longer a praxis. And yes, I use laptops, but since 
                      I suffer from Repetitive Strain Injury, it's more comfortable 
                      for me to use a traditional desktop computer</span>. </font></P>

                      Mathematics 
                      and algorithms seems to be at the root of your compositions. 
                      Are constraints an essential part of your way of composing 
                    ? Is it a kind of obsession for you ? </font></B></P>
                    <P ><span class="style2c">Yes, 
                      limitations are fundamental. We like to think of our world 
                      as limitless, that resources and the imagination have no 
                      limits; that you can be everything you want to be. This 
                      of course is a collective illusion. Humans are defined by 
                      their limitations as is the world and universe. By looking 
                      around one could even argue that the world must have been 
                      created by an imperfect demiurge, so we are created in the 
                      image of imperfection, we are fragments basically. So what 
                      I propose is a form of Post-human music, a music that knows 
                      about the design failures of humans and seeks to fundamentally 
                      reshape our DNA. Some of my works are aimed at the perception 
                      of future human beings, because for the most part I have 
                      faced incredible difficulty with today's humans just to 
                      get my work published &amp; staged. Most of it remains unpublished 
                      and without a performance venue. <STRIKE>People here in the U.S. 
                      take the validity of the monetary exchange system (and the 
                      stock market in particular) as axiomatic, so in the mathematical 
                      models that govern and represent our economy, in the random 
                      movement of stock prices, you see the same principles at 
                      work as in my music. And some of it is really just made 
                      up, with no current scientific basis whatsoever, like a

                      always shapes reality, ideology and ideas dominate and bend 
                      people's lives. <a href="http://rothkamm.com/record.cfm?LAX">LAX</a> is a re-enactment of the Y2K phenomena 
                      that swept through Los Angeles from 1998-2000. It was a 
                      collective hallucination and illusion on a grand scale, 
                      with the U.S. government and corporations actually spending 
                      millions of dollars trying to fix an imaginary problem. 
                      It led to the development of what I call a 'parallel reality' 
                      in the <a href="http://rothkamm.com/record.cfm?LAX">LAX</a> essay. <IMG src="pictures/hollywoodstudio1999-sm.jpg" width=570 height="198"> At the time I had set up a super-sized 
                      computer music studio, to do lots of parallel computations. 
                      This included multiple customized Atari ST based ADAP systems, 
                      with huge hard-drive cases, you know, my version of a &quot;supercomputer&quot;, 
                      which was made from old home computers. These were of course 
                      'Y2K' safe, because the Atari did not have a system clock. 
                      As you can see in the center of the picture, the iMac is 
                      the only contemporary computer for the time, because I only 
                      used it to make money in the Dotcom industry. My computations 
                      all dealt with uniform random distributions, some I executed 
                      on an 'analog computer' which was constructed from sine 
                      wave generators which had to be operated by hand. The most 
                      intense machine computation (done in my Forth based <a href="http://iformm.com">IFORMM</a> language and rendered in Csound) is in '<a href="http://rothkamm.com/work.cfm?opus=297">XFM OR New Encounter 
                      Architecture</a>', where the dense piece is shaped like the 
                      parabolic theme building you see on the cover of the <a href="http://rothkamm.com/record.cfm?LAX">LAX</a> CD. LAX basically 'moves to the extremes of culture and 
                      the culture to extremes' as it puts societies' illusions 
                      through computations based on the law of large numbers: 
                      the result is a new reality for the listener, a universal 
                      view. In 2005 I put all of this historic equipment into 
                      a house that was located on the estate of a friend of mine 
                      in Ramona, California, a town close to the Borrego-Springs desert. 
                      I put it there because I ran out of money and moved back 
                      to New York. On October 23, 2007 all of it was destroyed 
                      in the California Witch Fire.</span></P>

                      is a very good question. I don't think that anybody could 
                      necessary identify the same person with all of my works 
                      and this situation will not improve as time goes on. I'm 
                      unable to stick to any particular style or method for long. 
                      I always thought that when I got older I would have found 
                      my style and place in history, but the years passed, I got 
                      old and I'm still waiting. I guess in the concurrency of 
                      all styles and the omnipresence of history is where I have 
                      dissolved myself. Perhaps the 32 part FB01 trilogy has the 
                      greatest amount of coherence: It lasts 1 hour 55 minutes 
                      and 41 seconds and is meant to be performed on a 3D sound 
                      system in 3 locations in one evening: FB01 before sunset 
                      on the water, FB02 exactly at sunset on a rooftop, and FB03

                      I propose to do with Stockhausen. Let's never forget what 
                      it is written in 'Das Kapital': &quot;The mystification which 
                      dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no 
                      means prevents him from being the first to present its general 
                      form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. 
                      With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right 
                      side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel

                    <P><span class="style2c">To 
                      understand Sci-Fi Serialism it is necessary to contemplate 
                      first on the 3 principles of supermodernism: 1. Be utopian 
                      and scientific 2. Nod to the first pioneers 3. Make full 
                      use of left, right and phantom channel. Once these are fully 
                      comprehended, one may move on to the examination of Science 
                      Fiction and Serialism, which are different sides of the 
                      same coin: a) The invention of a science that does not yet 
                      exist leads to utopia, and b) Total Serialism leads to the 
                      parameterization of everything. Pop culture, on the other 
                      hand, is the best of all possible worlds at any moment in 
                      time. It is popular because it provides 'Wahrnehmungen' 
                      (sensations), either rhythmic or melodic, that are most 
                      agreeable to most people. Therefore, Sci-Fi Serialism aims 
                      at creating the utopia of the totality of perceptions, <STRIKE>very
